  "qa_report": "# Data Quality Assessment Report\n\n## 1. Executive Summary\n- Overall data quality score: 87.5% (21/24 checks passed)\n- Most critical finding: Two UTC calendar days are incomplete (not exactly 24 hourly records), indicating the time window is not aligned to midnight boundaries. While the series is continuous and hourly, daily aggregations for those two days will be biased.\n- Data readiness: Suitable for hourly trading and modeling with minor caveats; daily KPI/reporting requires boundary alignment and validation of one flagged outlier.\n\n## 2. Validation Results Overview\n\n| Check | Status | Impact |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n| 1. Timestamps parseable (UTC) | \u2713 | Foundational time alignment assured |\n| 2.

RES (wind+solar) > 3x load | \u2713 | No implausible RES dominance |\n\n## 3. Detailed Findings\n\n### 3.1 Passed Validations\n- Timestamp integrity: Parseable UTC timestamps, unique, aligned to HH:00:00, and strictly 1h spacing ensure robust time-series continuity\u2014critical for backtesting, curve building, and PnL attribution.\n- Completeness: Exactly 8,760 rows confirms non\u2011leap\u2011year hourly coverage (aggregate completeness).\n- Non-null coverage: No missing values in price_da, load_forecast, wind_forecast, solar_forecast\u2014enables uninterrupted model training and reporting.\n- Range plausibility: Prices within Euphemia bounds; load/wind/solar within plausible physical ranges\u2014limits risk of unit errors and gross outliers.\n- Volatility/ramps: No unrealistic hourly jumps in price or ramps in load/wind/solar\u2014reduces risk of timestamp misalignment and ingestion spikes.\n- Distribution checks: No 6\u2011sigma outliers in load, wind, or solar\u2014supports model stability for these features.\n- System balance plausibility: RES not exceeding 3x load\u2014guards against implausible overgeneration in a single bidding zone.\n\nWhy this matters: For energy trading, clean hourly structure and realistic magnitudes are essential to prevent mispriced orders, ensure correct VaR calculations, and produce reliable demand/supply forecasts.\n\n### 3.2 Failed Validations\n1) Each UTC day must have exactly 24 records (2 UTC dates fail)\n- Potential root cause:\n  - The dataset window is continuous hourly but offset from midnight boundaries (e.g., starts/ends mid\u2011day), producing two partial UTC days. Less likely: parsing boundary artifacts.\n- Impact:\n  - Daily aggregates (e.g., average price, demand totals) for those two days will be biased, impacting daily KPIs, settlement reconciliations, and reporting.\n- Severity: Medium\n\n2) Solar must be negligible (< 0.1 MW) during deep night (23:00\u201302:00 Europe/Brussels) (1 row fails)\n- Potential root cause:\n  - Minor timezone misalignment or forecast smoothing/rounding that yields a small nonzero value during night; ingestion mapping of local vs UTC may be off by one hour around DST edges.\n- Impact:\n  - Negligible effect on aggregate metrics; can slightly distort night RES share or model features that assume zero solar at night.\n- Severity: Low\n\n3) Price 6\u2011sigma outlier detection (1 row fails)\n- Potential root cause:\n  - Likely a legitimate market extreme (max observed 473.28 EUR/MWh; within Euphemia bounds and without unrealistic jump). Less likely: decimal/units ingestion issue.\n- Impact:\n  - Can unduly influence model training or scaling if not handled with robust methods; may affect alerts or risk thresholds.\n- Severity: Medium\n\n## 4. Risk Assessment\n- Data Reliability Rating: High\n- Key risks for production use:\n  - Misaligned daily boundaries causing biased daily aggregates for two UTC days.\n  - Single price 6\u2011sigma outlier influencing models/alerts if not robustly handled.\n  - Minor timezone/ingestion nuance leading to nonzero solar at deep night.\n  - Timestamp column currently named \u201cUnnamed: 0\u201d (object dtype); clarity and typing should be enforced for downstream systems.\n- Confidence level for forecasting models:\n  - High for load/wind/solar given completeness, plausibility, and smooth ramps.\n  - High (with caution) for price modeling; confirm outlier provenance and use robust scaling or outlier-aware training.\n\n## 5. Recommendations\n1. Normalize the time window to exact UTC calendar day boundaries (00:00 to 23:00) and re-run daily completeness check; trim/pad the first/last day as needed.\n2. Validate the single 6\u2011sigma price hour against ENTSO\u2011E/exchange; if confirmed legitimate, whitelist it for training or apply robust scaling (e.g., median/IQR, Huber loss) rather than clipping.\n3. Review and lock timezone handling:\n   - Ensure source timestamps are mapped consistently (ENTSO\u2011E often publishes in local CET/CEST). Keep a tz-aware UTC column and verify Europe/Brussels conversions across DST transitions.\n4. Address the night\u2011time solar anomaly:\n   - If caused by timezone misalignment, fix upstream; otherwise cap negligible nocturnal values to \u22640.1 MW post\u2011validation with proper data quality flags.\n5. Promote the timestamp to a typed, tz-aware index with a clear name (e.g., datetime_utc) and persist schema contracts in the ingestion layer.\n6. Add CI guardrails to fail ingestion when:\n   - Any UTC day \u2260 24 records\n   - Night\u2011time solar > 0.1 MW\n   - Unexpected unit/range violations\n7. Implement a lightweight DQ dashboard and alerting for all 24 checks, with special focus at year boundaries and DST weekends.\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n- Final verdict: Conditional Yes\n- Required actions before production use:\n  - Align the dataset to full UTC calendar days or clearly communicate and handle the two partial days in daily reporting.\n  - Confirm and document the single price outlier; adopt robust modeling practices.\n  - Verify timezone handling to eliminate the night\u2011time solar anomaly; standardize timestamp column and index.\n- Suggested monitoring going forward:\n  - Keep the three failing rules on alert, add boundary/DST-focused tests, and continuously track outlier frequencies to detect drift.\n\n---\nGenerated by LLM-Driven QA Pipeline",

This confirms parseability for time-based processing, though it doesn't validate semantic correctness (e.g., expected date ranges or intended timezone meaning).\n        \n        Rule 2: No duplicate UTC timestamps\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: pd.to_datetime(df['Unnamed: 0'], utc=True, errors='coerce').duplicated().sum()\n        Result Explanation: The check found zero duplicated UTC timestamps in the 'Unnamed: 0' column after parsing, so every parsed timestamp is unique. Note: unparsable values were coerced to NaT, and because the count is 0 there are no multiple NaT entries that would register as duplicates either.\n        \n        Rule 3: All timestamps must be aligned to the top of the hour (HH:00:00.000000)\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: (pd.to_datetime(df['Unnamed: 0'], utc=True, errors='coerce').dt.minute.ne(0) | pd.to_datetime(df['Unnamed: 0'], utc=True, errors='coerce').dt.second.ne(0) | pd.to_datetime(df['Unnamed: 0'], utc=True, errors='coerce').dt.microsecond.ne(0)).sum()\n        Result Explanation: The check counted rows whose minute, second, or microsecond are not zero; a result of 0 (PASSED) means no mismatches were found, so after UTC parsing all timestamps are exactly aligned to the top of the hour (HH:00:00.000000).\n        \n        Rule 4: Each UTC day must have exactly 24 records\n        Status: \u2717 FAILED\n        Details: [FAILED: 2 violations] Raw: 2\n        Code: pd.to_datetime(df['Unnamed: 0'], utc=True, errors='coerce').dt.floor('D').value_counts().ne(24).sum()\n        Result Explanation: Two UTC dates in the timestamp column (\"Unnamed: 0\") do not have exactly 24 hourly records, so the daily completeness check failed for 2 days. This typically indicates missing or extra hourly rows (or parsing/coercion to NaT), so inspect those two dates' raw timestamps for duplicates, gaps, or parse/timezone errors.\n        \n        Rule 5: Consecutive timestamps must be spaced exactly 1 hour (UTC)\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: pd.to_datetime(df['Unnamed: 0'], utc=True, errors='coerce').sort_values().diff().dropna().ne(pd.Timedelta(hours=1)).sum()\n        Result Explanation: All consecutive timestamps are exactly 1 hour apart in UTC, so there are no missing, duplicated, or irregular hourly records in the series. Because parsing used errors='coerce', this also implies there were no invalid timestamps coerced to NaT that would have hidden issues.\n        \n        Rule 6: Expected exactly 8760 hourly rows (non-leap year completeness)\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: (pd.Series([len(df)]) != 8760).sum()\n        Result Explanation: The check passed: the dataframe contains exactly 8,760 rows, matching the expected non\u2011leap\u2011year hourly count. Note this only verifies the total row count, not that timestamps are continuous, unique, or correctly ordered.\n        \n        Rule 7: Day-ahead prices cannot be null\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: df['price_da'].isna().sum()\n        Result Explanation: The check passed: there are zero nulls in the price_da column (Raw: 0), so the day-ahead price field is complete and meets the non-null expectation. Downstream processes and analyses that require day-ahead prices should not be impacted by missing values.\n        \n        Rule 8: Load forecasts cannot be null\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: df['load_forecast'].isna().sum()\n        Result Explanation: The check found zero nulls in the load_forecast column, so the non-null requirement is satisfied. This means downstream jobs can rely on a forecast value for every record (though you may still want to validate values/ranges for correctness).\n        \n        Rule 9: Wind forecasts cannot be null\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: df['wind_forecast'].isna().sum()\n        Result Explanation: The check found zero nulls in the wind_forecast column, so the rule \"Wind forecasts cannot be null\" is satisfied. This means every record contains a wind forecast value and the column is complete for downstream processes that require non-null wind forecasts.\n        \n        Rule 10: Solar forecasts cannot be null\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: df['solar_forecast'].isna().sum()\n        Result Explanation: The column contains zero missing values (0 nulls), so the non-null requirement for solar_forecast is satisfied. This indicates the forecast field is complete and should not cause downstream failures that assume every record has a forecast.\n        \n        Rule 11: Prices must be within Euphemia bounds [-500, 4000] EUR/MWh\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: ((df['price_da'] < -500) | (df['price_da'] > 4000)).sum()\n        Result Explanation: The check found zero records outside the allowed Euphemia range, so every day\u2011ahead price in df['price_da'] lies within [-500, 4000] EUR/MWh. This means there are no bound violations to remediate for this rule (continue to monitor for future data).\n        \n        Rule 12: Load must be positive and within a physically plausible upper bound (MW)\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: ((df['load_forecast'] <= 0) | (df['load_forecast'] > 200000)).sum()\n        Result Explanation: The check passed with zero violations, meaning every load_forecast value in the dataset is greater than 0 and at most 200,000 MW. This indicates no obvious non\u2011positive or physically implausible outliers by this rule (though other quality issues may still exist).\n        \n        Rule 13: Wind forecast must be non-negative and within a plausible upper bound (MW)\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: ((df['wind_forecast'] < 0) | (df['wind_forecast'] > 150000)).sum()\n        Result Explanation: No wind_forecast values were negative or exceeded 150,000 MW, so all records passed the enforced non\u2011negative and upper\u2011bound range check. This confirms range validity but does not guarantee the forecasts are otherwise correct (e.g., correct units, precision, or semantic accuracy).\n        \n        Rule 14: Solar forecast must be non-negative and within a plausible upper bound (MW)\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: ((df['solar_forecast'] < 0) | (df['solar_forecast'] > 150000)).sum()\n        Result Explanation: The check found zero records outside the allowed 0\u2013150,000 MW range, so the solar_forecast column contains no negative or implausibly large values. No remediation is required for this validation.\n        \n        Rule 15: Solar must be negligible (< 0.1 MW) during deep night (23:00\u201302:00, Europe/Brussels local time)\n        Status: \u2717 FAILED\n        Details: [FAILED: 1 violations] Raw: 1\n        Code: ((pd.to_datetime(df['Unnamed: 0'], utc=True, errors='coerce').dt.tz_convert('Europe/Brussels').dt.hour.isin([23, 0, 1, 2])) & (df['solar_forecast'] > 0.1)).sum()\n        Result Explanation: One row has a solar_forecast > 0.1 MW during local deep night (23:00\u201302:00 Europe/Brussels), so the expectation that solar should be negligible at those hours is violated. Investigate that specific record's timestamp and timezone/DST handling, the forecast source/ingestion for errors, and whether this value is an outlier that should be corrected or filtered.\n        \n        Rule 16: Price 6-sigma outlier detection\n        Status: \u2717 FAILED\n        Details: [FAILED: 1 violations] Raw: 1\n        Code: ((df['price_da'] - df['price_da'].mean()).abs() > (6 * df['price_da'].std())).sum()\n        Result Explanation: One record in price_da is more than six standard deviations from the column mean, i.e., a statistically extreme outlier. Inspect that row (source, units, decimal placement) to determine whether it\u2019s a data error or a legitimate rare value before using or aggregating the data.\n        \n        Rule 17: Load 6-sigma outlier detection\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: ((df['load_forecast'] - df['load_forecast'].mean()).abs() > (6 * df['load_forecast'].std())).sum()\n        Result Explanation: There are zero values in load_forecast more than 6 standard deviations away from the mean, so no extreme (6\u2011sigma) outliers were detected. This implies no gross anomalies in magnitude, but it doesn't rule out smaller outliers, distributional skew, or systematic bias that a 6\u2011sigma threshold would miss.\n        \n        Rule 18: Wind 6-sigma outlier detection\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: ((df['wind_forecast'] - df['wind_forecast'].mean()).abs() > (6 * df['wind_forecast'].std())).sum()\n        Result Explanation: No wind_forecast values exceed \u00b16 standard deviations from the mean, so this 6\u2011sigma outlier test found zero extreme outliers. Note this only rules out very large deviations \u2014 it doesn't detect smaller anomalies or issues from non\u2011normal/heavy\u2011tailed distributions or small sample sizes.\n        \n        Rule 19: Solar 6-sigma outlier detection\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: ((df['solar_forecast'] - df['solar_forecast'].mean()).abs() > (6 * df['solar_forecast'].std())).sum()\n        Result Explanation: No solar_forecast values exceed six standard deviations from the mean (0 flagged), so there are no extreme outliers by this 6\u2011sigma rule. This suggests no highly improbable spikes or drops were detected, though it doesn\u2019t rule out smaller anomalies or other quality issues.\n        \n        Rule 20: Unrealistic hourly price jumps (> 1000 EUR/MWh)\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: df['price_da'].diff().abs().gt(1000).sum()\n        Result Explanation: No consecutive hourly day-ahead prices differ by more than 1,000 EUR/MWh (0 occurrences), so there are no extreme hour-to-hour spikes detected by this rule. This indicates the series has no gross outliers or timestamp misalignments at that threshold, though smaller anomalies or different error modes could still exist.\n        \n        Rule 21: Unrealistic hourly load ramps (> 30,000 MW)\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: df['load_forecast'].diff().abs().gt(30000).sum()\n        Result Explanation: The check computed absolute hour-to-hour changes in the load_forecast and counted how many exceeded 30,000 MW; a result of 0 (PASSED) means there were no hourly jumps larger than that threshold. In other words, the forecast series contains no extreme one-hour spikes indicative of gross data errors or unrealistic ramps.\n        \n        Rule 22: Unrealistic hourly wind ramps (> 20,000 MW)\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: df['wind_forecast'].diff().abs().gt(20000).sum()\n        Result Explanation: Zero rows exceeded an absolute hourly change of 20,000 MW in wind_forecast, so the check passed. This indicates no implausibly large hourly wind forecast ramps were found in the raw data, reducing the likelihood of gross data-entry or unit errors (assuming 20,000 MW is an appropriate threshold).\n        \n        Rule 23: Unrealistic hourly solar ramps (> 20,000 MW)\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: df['solar_forecast'].diff().abs().gt(20000).sum()\n        Result Explanation: No hourly change in the solar_forecast exceeded the 20,000 MW threshold (count = 0), so the series shows no extreme step jumps at this check. This indicates the forecasts have no gross spikes or implausible hourly ramps that would suggest major measurement or ingestion errors.\n        \n        Rule 24: Renewables exceeding 3x load is implausible for a single bidding zone\n        Status: \u2713 PASSED\n        Details: [PASSED] Raw: 0\n        Code: ((df['wind_forecast'] + df['solar_forecast']) > (3 * df['load_forecast'])).sum()\n        Result Explanation: No rows were found where wind + solar forecast exceeds three times the load forecast, so the dataset passes this implausibility/outlier check. This indicates there are no extreme overestimates of renewable generation at the bidding-zone level, though you should still run complementary quality checks (e.g., missing/negative values, temporal consistency).\n        \n\n    === YOUR TASK ===\n    Write a professional Data Quality Assessment Report in Markdown format.\n\n    REQUIRED SECTIONS:\n\n    # Data Quality Assessment Report\n\n    ## 1.

Executive Summary\n- Overall data quality score: 87.5% (21/24 checks passed)\n- Most critical finding: Two UTC calendar days are incomplete (not exactly 24 hourly records), indicating the time window is not aligned to midnight boundaries. While the series is continuous and hourly, daily aggregations for those two days will be biased.\n- Data readiness: Suitable for hourly trading and modeling with minor caveats; daily KPI/reporting requires boundary alignment and validation of one flagged outlier.\n\n## 2.

Detailed Findings\n\n### 3.1 Passed Validations\n- Timestamp integrity: Parseable UTC timestamps, unique, aligned to HH:00:00, and strictly 1h spacing ensure robust time-series continuity\u2014critical for backtesting, curve building, and PnL attribution.\n- Completeness: Exactly 8,760 rows confirms non\u2011leap\u2011year hourly coverage (aggregate completeness).\n- Non-null coverage: No missing values in price_da, load_forecast, wind_forecast, solar_forecast\u2014enables uninterrupted model training and reporting.\n- Range plausibility: Prices within Euphemia bounds; load/wind/solar within plausible physical ranges\u2014limits risk of unit errors and gross outliers.\n- Volatility/ramps: No unrealistic hourly jumps in price or ramps in load/wind/solar\u2014reduces risk of timestamp misalignment and ingestion spikes.\n- Distribution checks: No 6\u2011sigma outliers in load, wind, or solar\u2014supports model stability for these features.\n- System balance plausibility: RES not exceeding 3x load\u2014guards against implausible overgeneration in a single bidding zone.\n\nWhy this matters: For energy trading, clean hourly structure and realistic magnitudes are essential to prevent mispriced orders, ensure correct VaR calculations, and produce reliable demand/supply forecasts.\n\n### 3.2 Failed Validations\n1) Each UTC day must have exactly 24 records (2 UTC dates fail)\n- Potential root cause:\n  - The dataset window is continuous hourly but offset from midnight boundaries (e.g., starts/ends mid\u2011day), producing two partial UTC days. Less likely: parsing boundary artifacts.\n- Impact:\n  - Daily aggregates (e.g., average price, demand totals) for those two days will be biased, impacting daily KPIs, settlement reconciliations, and reporting.\n- Severity: Medium\n\n2) Solar must be negligible (< 0.1 MW) during deep night (23:00\u201302:00 Europe/Brussels) (1 row fails)\n- Potential root cause:\n  - Minor timezone misalignment or forecast smoothing/rounding that yields a small nonzero value during night; ingestion mapping of local vs UTC may be off by one hour around DST edges.\n- Impact:\n  - Negligible effect on aggregate metrics; can slightly distort night RES share or model features that assume zero solar at night.\n- Severity: Low\n\n3) Price 6\u2011sigma outlier detection (1 row fails)\n- Potential root cause:\n  - Likely a legitimate market extreme (max observed 473.28 EUR/MWh; within Euphemia bounds and without unrealistic jump). Less likely: decimal/units ingestion issue.\n- Impact:\n  - Can unduly influence model training or scaling if not handled with robust methods; may affect alerts or risk thresholds.\n- Severity: Medium\n\n## 4. Risk Assessment\n- Data Reliability Rating: High\n- Key risks for production use:\n  - Misaligned daily boundaries causing biased daily aggregates for two UTC days.\n  - Single price 6\u2011sigma outlier influencing models/alerts if not robustly handled.\n  - Minor timezone/ingestion nuance leading to nonzero solar at deep night.\n  - Timestamp column currently named \u201cUnnamed: 0\u201d (object dtype); clarity and typing should be enforced for downstream systems.\n- Confidence level for forecasting models:\n  - High for load/wind/solar given completeness, plausibility, and smooth ramps.\n  - High (with caution) for price modeling; confirm outlier provenance and use robust scaling or outlier-aware training.\n\n## 5. Recommendations\n1. Normalize the time window to exact UTC calendar day boundaries (00:00 to 23:00) and re-run daily completeness check; trim/pad the first/last day as needed.\n2. Validate the single 6\u2011sigma price hour against ENTSO\u2011E/exchange; if confirmed legitimate, whitelist it for training or apply robust scaling (e.g., median/IQR, Huber loss) rather than clipping.\n3. Review and lock timezone handling:\n   - Ensure source timestamps are mapped consistently (ENTSO\u2011E often publishes in local CET/CEST). Keep a tz-aware UTC column and verify Europe/Brussels conversions across DST transitions.\n4. Address the night\u2011time solar anomaly:\n   - If caused by timezone misalignment, fix upstream; otherwise cap negligible nocturnal values to \u22640.1 MW post\u2011validation with proper data quality flags.\n5. Promote the timestamp to a typed, tz-aware index with a clear name (e.g., datetime_utc) and persist schema contracts in the ingestion layer.\n6. Add CI guardrails to fail ingestion when:\n   - Any UTC day \u2260 24 records\n   - Night\u2011time solar > 0.1 MW\n   - Unexpected unit/range violations\n7. Implement a lightweight DQ dashboard and alerting for all 24 checks, with special focus at year boundaries and DST weekends.\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n- Final verdict: Conditional Yes\n- Required actions before production use:\n  - Align the dataset to full UTC calendar days or clearly communicate and handle the two partial days in daily reporting.\n  - Confirm and document the single price outlier; adopt robust modeling practices.\n  - Verify timezone handling to eliminate the night\u2011time solar anomaly; standardize timestamp column and index.\n- Suggested monitoring going forward:\n  - Keep the three failing rules on alert, add boundary/DST-focused tests, and continuously track outlier frequencies to detect drift.\n\n---\nGenerated by LLM-Driven QA Pipeline"
